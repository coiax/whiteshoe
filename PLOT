The giant freighter Fractillion crashed ashore last week. Chaos erupted in a
surge of wild light and colour. Although no one was hurt, you felt like a seed
was planted in your mind.

You can see it in your mind's eye now, hovering slightly off the floor, the
Key of Seventeen Meanings. Forged in brass and gold, below the heat of a
thousand hooves thundering into the dark.

You cannot sleep. You cannot eat. The Key must be yours.

In the dead of night, you gather your meagre possessions, and cross the
threshold into the sleeping hulk. Others do the same.

The world swirls around all of your feet, freeing the nearby inhabitants of the
Fractillion from their eternal. For better or for worse, there is no going
back.

Go bravely, for the memory of the Fractillion!

You were a young child when the giant space freighter Fractillion crashed
on the sea shore. There was a huge explosion of wild light and colour, and the
ground shook severely.

The Fractillion was said to be one of a kind, and all manner of treasures
and exotic items could be found in its seemingly infinite depths. However,
despite rumours of vicious creatures within, many adventurers from across the
globe gained entry, never to be seen again.

Lately, you've been troubled by dreams, images of the fabled Key of Seventeen
Meanings, which purportedly lies at the very bottom of the craft. You tried
to resist, but know in your heart that only death or possession will release
you from your desire for the Key, which is why you, possibly aided by friends
similarily afflicted, now stand at the precipice.

You close your eyes, and cross the threshold. Blackness swirls around you...
